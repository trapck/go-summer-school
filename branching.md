## Branches

`main` - main development branch

`release/*` - branches for a release ready codebase with new features

`hotpatch/*` - branches for hotfixes and hot-change requests

`feat/*, fix/*, chore/*` - work branches

## Release branch naming

Release of a signle service - `release/{current date}-{service name}` (e.g. `release/20220517-mpi`)

Release with multiple services - `release/{current date}` (e.g. `release/20220517`)

## Hotpatch branch naming

`hotpatch/{current date}-{service name}-{service version before patch}` (e.g. `release/20220517-mpi-v0.5.0`)

## Work branch naming

`feat(fix, chore)/{service name}-{task number}-{short description}` (e.g. `feat/mpi-27-provide-logging`)


## Commit message

We use commit messages according to [conventions](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

__Allowed commit types__ -  `feat, fix, chore`.

__Commit message title__ - `{commit type}[{scope}]: {message} (#{PR number})`.
For example `feat[service1,service2,pkg]:  provide HTTP requests logging (#13)`.
It is required to write a human readable, understandable message that will be clear for everyone.

__Commit message description__ - an additional commit info. Should be provided when it is unable to provide
all the necessary information in the commit title. Lines should not be too long.
Each new line should start with `** `. For example:
```
** improved the logging package to write fromatted logs
** used the new log formatting in the services
```

__Breaking change__ - it is required to add the [breaking change message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#commit-message-with-description-and-breaking-change-footer) if the commit violates back compatibility

These requirements refers only commits that will appear in the final git history after `squashing`.
Local draft commit messages are up to you.

## Development process

To introduce a new feature:

- create a branch from the `main` branch. The branch's name should meet the [convention](`#work-branch-naming`).
- develop the feature in the created branch.
- create a pull request (PR) intended to merge the branch into the `main` branch.
- fill the PR's template.
- ensure that the lint and test processes (auto invoked github actions) are finished with success.
- start a code review process. The PR should be reviewed by at least two team members and be approved by all of them.
  all the conversations should be closed before merge. Conversations may be closed only by the author of the connversation
- merge the branch via `squash and merge`. Add commit message using [conventions](https://github.com/rbi-ri/poc.bp.api/blob/main/branching.md#commit-message)
- delete the branch.
- ensure that all the CI processes (auto invoked github actions) are finished with success.






==============

## Bugfix process

We can devide bugs into two categories:
- urgent (hotfixes). Should be fixed and merged into `staging` before an upcoming release.
  A fix process for such bugs is described in the `Urgent changes process` section.
- regular. Should be fixed following the regular `Development process` section.
  They will be meged into `staging` with the upcoming release.

Both of them should be finished with creating git tag and github release (or pre-release for stage) according to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) that affects patch version. (e.g. v.1.2.1 or v.1.2.1-stage)


## Urgent changes process

Sometimes we need to develop and merge some functionality (whatever hotfix or urgent change request)
into `staging` before an upcoming release. In such case we need to make the required changes locally,
merge them into `staging`, merge `staging` into `main` to include these changes in the upcoming release as well:

- create a branch from `staging`.
- make changes.
- create a PR intended to merge the branch into `staging`.
- complete the lint, test and code review processes.
- merge the branch via "squash and merge".
- delete the branch.
- ensure all the CI processes are finished with success.
- make the local `main` and `staging` branches up to date.
- create a "merge staging into main" branch from `main`.
- merge `staging` into the created branch (fix conflicts if they are occured).
- create a PR intended to merge the branch into `main`.
- complete the lint and test processes (code review is not required).
- merge the branch via "merge commit".
- delete the branch.
- ensure all the CI processes are finished with success.
- ensure that `staging` branch is not ahead of `main`.
